            Certain species of owls are captive-bred, specifically the Eurasian
            Eagle Owl, and these owls typically sell for around $3,000 to
            $3,500. Since it is illegal to own an owl without the proper
            licenses and/or permits, the average United States citizen will find
            it extremely hard to adopt one unless they have the right permits.
            In the United Kingdom, however, the laws are different as some owls
            can cost $300 to $800 to adopt by anyone. Even if you wanted to own
            an owl, they are known to make awful pets as they tend to avoid
            bonding, have very little brian power and are quite devoted to
            hunting.
